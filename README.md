People living in European and South American countries are passionate about football.

Americans love their version of football and basketball.

We from the subcontinent share similar love for cricket. (Not to be confused with the insect).

If you happen to catch a replay of any cricket match involving the Indian team in the early 2000s, there's a good chance for you to come across a board sign in the audience reading, "Cricket is my religion, and Sachin is my God." 

Sachin Tendulkar, the greatest player ever to grace the game of cricket, has demigod status in India and once used to be on the walls of almost every Indian teenager in the form of posters.

For a typical Indian kid, along with the various phases of adolescence, there used to be another phase running parallelly where a fanaticism for cricket kicks in and solidifies with time.

Cricket is the medium that introduces statistics to many Indian kids for the first time in the form of averages, net run rates, strike rates, etc. 

I found a dataset on Kaggle today (sourced originally from ESPNcricinfo) that consists of score statistics for individual players in the international innings between 1982 to 2022.

I decided to perform data analysis on it, which made me travel through a nostalgic memory lane back in time.

This notebook doesn't just contain the Python code of this project. It holds several magical memories and fascinating cricket trivia.
